# Drowsiness Detection System

A system which alarms the driver as soon as it detects that the driver is becoming drowsy to prevent any road accident.\
Drowsiness is detected by calculating eye aspect ratio and mouth aspect ratio and comparing it with the threshold value.\
The threshold value of the eye aspect ratio is calculated dynamically from the maximum and minimum eye aspect ratios.\
An alarm is triggered if a driver is drowsy for 20 consecutive frames.
